# Week 3

- Selection sort: iterates through the unsorted part, selecting the smallest element each time, and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part (moving it to its correct position).
- Bubble sort: compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. continues to do so until the entire array is sorted.
- Merge sort: recursively divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together.
